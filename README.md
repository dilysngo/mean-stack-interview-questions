  ` Click ⭐if you like the project. Pull Request is highly appreciated. `

  Essentially, MEAN stack is an open-source technology that includes four JavaScript-based technologies including MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, Node.js (MEAN). By learning and mastering MEAN stack, you can enjoy the perks of a host of domains for developing web apps and dynamic websites.

### JS + Nodejs
   - Why? What?
	
   - EventLoop
	
   - How single threaded? 
   
   - threadpool? Libuv module

   - why express?  
	middleware  
					
   - streams
   
   - event emitter
	
   - how to handle unhandledRejection, uncaughtException
   
   - module.exports vs export

   - higher order function
	 - callbacks
		real use case   
		callback hell ? and example   
					
	 - promises  
		real use case  
		chaining  
		promiseall vs race  
			
	 - async/await  
	 	real use case   

  - Hoisting? let, var, const,normal funtion  
	why function as expression not hoisted.  
	"use strict"  
		
  - call, apply, bind  / context switching
  - prototype
  - closure
  - classes in es5 & es6

  - array > filter map reduce foreach  
	
  - functions > iffe, expression, normal function  

 - es6 features  
 	fat arrow > significance and use  
	classes  
	literal string  
	destructuring object  
	rest and spread > significance and use  

  - Scope in JavaScript > global local lexical	
		
 - File system(fs)  
	asynchronous > methods  
	synchronous > methods  
	
  - settimeout, setimmediate,setInterval 
	
  - chron job
					
#### Advance Question 
	web worker
	threads
	spawn
	cors issue > resolution & internal working
	virtual dom,real dom,real dom,shadow dom  
	scaling
	
### Angular
 - Angular start point 
	purpose index.html
	main.ts
	
  - decorators?  
  
  - Module? imports,declaration,providers
	
  - Service?  
	@injectable => providedin  
	how to make singleton service > 1. providedin="root" 2.providedin="Module_Name"  
			
  - Components?  
	Lifecyclehooks?  
		children method  
		why ngOnchanges called first  			
		parameters  
		can we provide service directly in component? how? how many instances created?  
		
  - Pipes  
	Custom Pipes ? how to implement and real example  
	Pure pipes  
	Custom Pipes ? how to implement and real example  
		
 - Directives 
	Types > why component is directive  
	
 - content projection
 
 - elvis operator	
		
 - Observalables vs promises?  
		why observables are prefered  
		Subjects? Subjects vs BehaviorSubjects vs ReplaySubjects  	
		observables chaining  
			
  - Interceptor > how to use? use cases
	
  - package.json& package-lock.json	> rough idea of contents of both  
 	angular.json  
    	tsconfig.json  
	
  - Data passing between components

  - local storage, session storage and cookies

  - Karma & Jasmine? describe, it, Spyon, Spy, beforeEach, expect

  - Event binding & Property binding
	
  - Event bubbling
	stop propagation vs prevent default  
	event delegation  
		
  - url/dom sanitization

  - Share data between component methods > total 5 method (state any 2-4)
	
  - ng-container vs ng-template
	
  - content projection
	
  - security features in your application
	
  - change detection
	ngzone
	which component lifecyclehook called
	
### Mongodb
	Why mongoose? > any other orm  
  		find  
  	aggregate > stages  
    	joins($loookup) > foreign key, left outer join only  
    	optimization  
  	replica  
  	sharding  
  	cluster  
	
### JWT 
	Why?  
   	   (rough idea) how it works  
	methods > use  
  	bcrypt vs jwt  
	
### RestApi
	Why?  What?  

### Programs
	string reverse (using inbuilt methods and by loop) 1. simple 2. sentence( normal, word by word reverse) 
	string manipulation (using inbuilt methods and by loop) 
	fibonacci series (using recursion and loop) 1. simple 2. till n terms 
	palindrome(string and number) 
	array (sort, find,remove duplicates, replace value, reverse) 
	let var const 
	0.1+0.2==0.3 (reason why not equal) 
	console.log(3>2>1)	console.log(1<2<3) 
	console.log(1 ?? 3)
